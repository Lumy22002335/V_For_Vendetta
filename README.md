#
# **1. Overview**

## 1.1. Pitch

V for Vendetta is a 2D, side-scroller, point-and-click game where the player plays as V (the main character), the player visits V&#39;s past at Larkhill Resettlement Camp. The player can walk through the various floors (-1, 0, 1, garden and garden shed). The floors have various rooms where the player can explore and complete missions. V&#39;s main mission is to get a flame to explode the whole camp.

## 1.2. Genre

V for Vendetta is a 2D, side-scroller, point-and-click, horror game.

## 1.3. Unique Selling Points

To the date, there are not complete stories on the internet about V&#39;s past, let alone a 2D side-scrolling game. We barely know anything about his time in the lab, which makes this game very interesting, specially for fans of the movie who love V and his personality.

## 1.4. Target Platform

The game will be available on PC (Browser and Windows).

## 1.5. Target Audience

The game will be telling a lot about illegal human experiments, abuse, and corruption, which makes it not a very family friendly and classifies it as horror. Just like the movie, the game is for a more mature audience (16+).

#
# **2. Gameplay**

## 2.1. Overview

You play as V from V for Vendetta, the player wakes up in a cell at Larkhill Resettlement Camp. The player goes through V&#39;s time at the camp, the abuse, and corruption he had to go through. Being a side-scroller, the enemies will consist of guards. The game has many rooms and floors. V wakes up in his cell on -1. On this floor there will be 5 cells with many prisoners and a guard walking around. On the 0 floor there is a receptionist and 1 guard. The receptionist protects a key and a card that opens the elevator. There is a bathroom there that V has to use to complete one mission. On the same floor V can go to the garden and garden shed where he collects the tools to use for the explosion. On the 1 floor there is the final mission. V has to get out of his cell and go to the 1 floor to grab matchsticks to ignite a fire in his cell and destroy the camp to escape. Most of the time, the player will not be able to run away or attack the enemies because the game will mainly be about telling his story. V will talk guards, there will be times where he will be able to walk through the corridors and hide from the enemies. The game ends with V getting out of the flames after the fire like in the movie.

## 2.2. Camara

The camara will follow the player through the game. It will be like a normal 2D side scroller.

## 2.3. Movement

The player will be able to walk left and right, crouch to pick up things, and hide to avoid enemies.

The player will be detected by the enemy if he enters his cone of vision. The player can avoid this by hiding. If he is detected/caught, the game starts over from the last checkpoint.

The player and the enemies do not make noises.

## 2.5. Hiding

# **3. Story**

## 3.1. Set-Up

V wakes up in a cell at Larkhill Resettlement Camp. He goes through his trauma and re-lives the abuse, and corruption he had to go through. He was able to gain the trust of some guards and saw an opportunity to start gathering materials, with these materials he was able to create napalm... Now he only needs to find a way to create a flame or a spark and blow this whole compound to the ground. The game will show a cutscene of V in the flames and his famous line: &quot;Beneath this mask there is more than flesh, beneath this mask there is an idea, (…) and _ **ideas are bulletproof** __&quot;._

## 3.2. Drive

V must walk around, hide, survive, and find the matches to ignite the napalm and create an explosion allowing him to escape the concentration camp.
